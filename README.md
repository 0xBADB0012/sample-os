A sample OS as demonstrated in the book Operating System: From 0 to 1

This is the initial OS version I wrote for demonstration of the book "Operating System: From 0 to 1". Not the most stellar C code, but you can refer to it for checking the correctness of your code. That's also the reason why I want you to write your own code using guidelines from the book, and it is also one important goal of the book.
